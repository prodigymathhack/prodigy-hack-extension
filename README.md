***What is a prodigy epic code generator?***

Epic Code Generator Prodigy 
 Prodigy Epics can only be purchased and shipped to Canada and the United States from the Official EPIC Toy Store. When you purchase a toy box, Prodigy will ship it to you. The box contains a code to redeem the very toy sent from the game world. 
 With toy boxes priced between $10 and  $60, Prodigy gamers are always looking for a Prodigy Epic Code generator to beat the system. This is very difficult because Prodigy does not have a predefined set of codes  waiting to be exchanged. They keep  the code short, so it's very unlikely that the  code generator will guess correctly. The safest way to get Prodigy Epic codes is to buy them. 
 All Epic Codes can only be used once, leaving much less room for additional code. 
 Available Prodigy Epic Code generators have a higher hit rate. Developers understand the symbols used in the code and the current length of the code. The generator tries to reproduce this, leaving you with the option to try multiple codes.
